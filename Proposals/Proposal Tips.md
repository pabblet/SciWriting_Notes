- The Organising Proposal Committee — OPC
	 - Composed of peers:
		- At ESO (or HST) there are sub-panels that consist of experts in the broad area
		- In national TACs there is usually only one group
		- The reviewer is unlikely to be an expert on your topic, so the proposal must be understandable for a non-expert

- Make your science understandable:
	- Be explicit, do not assume that the panel will work out what you meant
	- If the reviewer does not immediately understand what you say you are lost

- What makes a proposal successful?
	- Exciting science:
		- Providing a clear progress in our understanding of some phenomenon
	- A neat idea:
		- Unusual method, new idea, new approach, unique observation or experiment
	- Clear language:
		- Presentation of an exciting story, which is interesting for many people
		- Cover all questions somebody may have
		- Is well written and not wordy
	- A consistent story: 
		- The proposal is complete and provides all information
		- Quantitative arguments for the amount (of time, of money, ...) requested

- A proposal with a goo idea but poorly written will be rejected
- A proposal with an average idea but well written may get accepted

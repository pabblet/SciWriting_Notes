- A proposal is a sales tool, not an information packet
- The purpose is to make a persuasive case that leads to telescope time, a job, money, etc.
- The same rules apply:
	- Is this proposal compliant?
	- Does this proposal make sense?
	- Does the solution provide value?
- Many proposals to be read by committee
- A proposal must be concise and clear! Get your point across quickly and efficiently

1. Create an outline of what you will discuss
2. Write a draft — just get something down on paper
3.  Revise, revise, revise
4.  Obtain peer feedback on the draft (also from colleagues not in your field)
5.  Revise again

- Every proposal reader constantly scans for clear answers to 3 questions:
	1. What are we going to learn as the result of the proposed project that we do not yet know?
	2. Why is it worth knowing?
	3. How will we know that the conclusions are valid?

- Make it clear that your proposal will really answer the question at hand 
- Find equilibrium between being *ambitious* and *boastful*
- A good proposal:
	- Good proposals include some background on the subject you are studying, in particular why anyone not in your specific field should care
	- Then you can explain what exactly you want to do, and why it will solve every problem left in astronomy and find a cure for the common cold
	- Adding good figures and tables almost always makes a proposal stronger and easier to understand for the reviewers
- Start with a sentence that trigger interest
- Project enthusiasm and optimism
	- Some examples of enthusiastic words are: Stunning, Revolutionary, Best, Great, Remarkable, Awesome, Beautiful, ...
- Things to avoid in a proposal
	- Avoid empty sentences:
		- Avoid generic and empty sentences, especially at the start of your proposal
		- i.e. 'The study of [...] is one of the key fields of modern astrophysics.'
		- One can replace ... by your preferred subject and it will be true. But it doesn't tell us anything. I didn't learn anything, and I have now the feeling I will lose my time
	- Avoid negative expressions
		- Negative expressions leave a more lasting impression on our psyche than positive ones
		- Specifically, negative messages have something like 5 to 7 times as powerful an impact on our minds as positive messages
		- On a review panel, any negative impression you give will stay and will be difficult to erase
	- Avoid Negative comments at all cost!
		- Referees often think they are not doing their job unless they come up with some critical points, so don't make their job easier!
		- Be honest, but cast things in a positive way

- **Title:**
	- Get a catchy title
		- Likely done at the end and should be well thought
		- Describes content in an honest, but attractive way
		- To the point — reviewer should understand what the proposal is about
	- Improving the title (example)
		- Before: 'Unveiling the 50 Myr-old two-Neptune system TOI-942 with JWST's transmission spectroscopy'
		- After: 'A comparative study of disequilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of very young Neptunes'
- **Abstract:**
	- Unlike for paper, write the abstract of your proposal first
	- This ensure you have a good idea
	- The abstract **HAS** to contain the punch line

- **Core of the proposal:**
	- Put your science into context, so that its relevance for the broader picture, its potencial impact, and its timelines can be appreciated by referees
	- Be specific about the expected outcome of the project
		- What is the <u>quantitative</u> information about the target that should be obtained?
		- Which <u>physical processes</u> will this information constrain, and how?
		- Will the data be compared to <u>theoretical models</u>? Do these model already exist? If not, when and how will they be developed?

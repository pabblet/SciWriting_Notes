- Start with something your audience will be interested in!
- Tell them why they should care
- Opening: the main impressions you want to make
	- You know your field
	- You are possessed of the scientific curiosity
	- You enjoy doing research
	- You plan to convey some useful and interesting information
- Prepare an opening (choose one)
	- Ask a rhetorical question — 'What is dark matter? And does it even exist?'
	- Challenge the audience — 'I urge you to acquire the necessary communication skills'
	- Make a startling statement or show a nice figure — 'To be a good scientist, you need to be a good communicator'
	- Quote an authority — 'As Richard Feynman said, "I'm smart enough to know that I'm dumb"'
	- Promise benefits — 'At the end of this presentation, you will have learned several techniques to give a stunning presentation'
- Tie the loop
	- Think of your speech as a loop: the ending should return to the beginning
		- If you open with a provocative question, be sure to answer it in your closing
		- If you open with a promise to inform, tell them at the end what they learned
- Don't overestimate your audience
	- They want you to say what is important in your field
	- They don't mind hearing things they already understand

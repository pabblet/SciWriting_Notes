- Question yourself
	- Why do you give this talk?
	- What is your message?
	- What should they remember?

- Make a story on paper

- Slides comes after you have the story to tell
	- Choose a design
	- Decide on fonts to use (max. 2)
		- Ensure that all text is easy to read:
			- Use 18-36 pts font to be seen in the back of the presentation room
			- Use smaller fonts for citations dan footnotes
			- On a slide, it is harder to read <u>underlined words</u> or words in ALL CAPS
			- If you want to emphasise a word, use **bold letters**, *italics* or use colour!
			- It is not necessary to put your name or the title of the presentation in every slide nor enumerate them all
	- Decide on colour scheme
		- Create contrast and keep it super simple
		- Use backgrounds that lack visual content to optimise foreground content
		- Prefer to use a dark slide background to create contrast
			- In some cases (small room, bad projector) use a white slide background

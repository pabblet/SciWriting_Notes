- Never overestimate the interest of people for astronomy! (we are biased)
- Be sure to know what your audience knows before engaging with them
- Choose your words carefully
- Give a human dimension to your science:
	- Metaphors
		- '1 microarcsecond correspond to viewing the shape of a golf ball at more than 8,000 km distance.'
		- 'The energy of the new subatomic particle is equivalent to that of a baseball traveling a hundred kilometres an hour'
		- Don't say 13.7%, say one out of seven
	- Alternative framing
		- '99% of young Londoners do not commit serious youth violence.'
		- Then, 1% of young Londoners do commit serious violence
		- Given the population of London: There are 10,000 seriously violent young people in the city!
		- Numbers don't speak for themselves
- Words have meaning
	- Choose carefully your words, since the meaning can change depending on the public you are talking to

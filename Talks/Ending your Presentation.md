- Do not put lot of text
- Don't finish with 'Thank you' slide
- Finish with main result and figure (+ name and contact details)
- Primacy and Recency effects:
	- People remember best what they heard first and last
- End your talk with a summary diagram of your conclusions
- Benjamin Franklin effect:
	- '_He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged_.'
	- More sinister side: if someone does something to harm you, they become more likely to do so again. That is something to avoid
	- Thus, it is better to keep your presentation on time rather than be asked to end it (don’t make it too short neither)
- Memorise the opening, transitions, and closing
	- Don't memorise the rest, but practice, expressing your key ideas aloud, in complete sentences

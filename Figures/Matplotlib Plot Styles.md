- Try different plots to know which one works better
- Create set of plots, one for your paper, and another one for the talk (easier to read increase label sizes, black background is better for talks)
- Do not blindly trust the defaults
	- You can make it much more impressive and easier to understand
	- Beware also of tick and ticklabel defaults, they are often too small
- plt.xkcd() sketch style
	- Using a sketch style conveys to the viewer that the data is approximate, and that it is the higher-level concepts rather than low-level details that are important

- Colours palettes
	- Complementary colours — Good for showing **differences** in datasets
	- Analogous colours — Great for showing **similarities** in datasets
	- Triad colours — Good for showing **differences** in datasets with more variety than complementary colours
- When is colour bad?
	- Too many colours kill the colours
	- Take care about how color-blind people will see it
- Generating accessible images
	- Do not use rainbows. Use a perceptually uniform colour map, such as viridis or cividis
	- Avoid red. Especially in combination with green
	- Go grey. Check your figure in greyscale, or by completely desaturating it
	- Pick a palette. Choose one that works for everyone
	- Think bigger. Use features such as shapes and line textures to disambiguate colour

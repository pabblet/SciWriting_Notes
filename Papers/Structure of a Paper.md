- **Introduction:** ^2684e7
	1. Establishing a territory
		- Established the field of work and importance
		- Generalisations
		- Refer to items of previous research
		- Explicitly narrow the focus (Example: In particular...)
		- Use **emphatic** words
	2. Establishing a niche
		- Refers to existing research to indicate gaps
	3. Occupying the niche
		- Introduces the new research
		- State the purpose of the research
		- Describe the research done by the authors
		- Mention the principal findings
		- **No need for an outline!**
	- In writing the literature review, summarise rather than list every possible reference and example
		- Cite latest review or paper and say 'and refs. therein'
	- Structure:
		- Paragraph 1: What do we know?
		- Paragraph 2: What we don't know
		- Paragraph 3: What we did and the result
	- Think about it when you begin a project, not when you complete it
		-  The reasons that you found the project interesting enough to work on provide **half the material** needed for the introduction
		- The remaining is a summary of the key results
- **Methods:** ^7c3be7
	- Give a clear overview of what was done
	- Give enough information to replicate the study (like a recipe)
	- Be complete, but minimise complexity:
		- Break into smaller sections with subheads
		- Move technical details in Appendix
		- Give a reference for commonly used methods
		- Don't give details about things everybody knows (such as data reduction that always is used)
		- Report methods in past tense (we measured...)
		- Use present tense to describe how data are presented in the paper (data are summarised as means +- std)
- **Results:** ^ce0a5c
	- Present facts
		- The output of the experiments, model, or computation
		- No opinion or interpretation
		- Give error bars
	- Most data belong in figures and tables
		- These should have self-contained captions and being referenced in the text
	- Report results pertinent to the main question asked
	- Summarise the data (big picture), and report trends
- **Discussion:**
	- The purpose of the discussion:
		- Answer the question posed in the [[pablet/Workshops — Conferences/ESO — Scientific Writing and Communicating your Science/Papers/Structure of a Paper#^2684e7|Introduction]]
		- Support your conclusions with details
		- Defend your conclusion
		- Highlight the broader implications of the work
	- Things to Avoid in the:
		- Do not simply repeat what is in the [[pablet/Workshops — Conferences/ESO — Scientific Writing and Communicating your Science/Papers/Structure of a Paper#^ce0a5c|Results]] section
		- Do not try to explain every minor flaw
		- Do not attempt to explain away every unexpected result (you can make another paper if it's necessary)
		- Do not exaggerate or make extravagant claims
- **Conclusion:**
	- We are researchers... not finders
	-  New questions that appeared from this work!
	- What is next for you or others working in the field?
	- What is the take home message?
- **Abstract:**
	- Overview of the main story, there should be an element from every section
	- Give highlights from each section of the paper
	- Limited length (100 - 300 words, typically)
	- Stands on its own, people should fully understand what the work is
	- Abstract and paper are independent. Redefine acronyms on the paper even if they are in the abstract.
- **Title:**
	- Describes the paper's content clearly and precisely including keywords
	- Is the advertisement for the article
	- Does not uses abbreviations and jargon
	- Search engines/indexing databases depend on the accuracy of the title — since they use the keywords to identify relevant articles 
	- For a paper, it should never be a question
	- Options for a Title:
		- Summarise the issue addressed in the paper
		- Use words that surprise or encourage curiosity
		- Use words or phrases that have double or clever meanings
		- Take a common phrase and put a spin on it (i.e. When Good Writers Go Bad)
	- Be aware of Alliterations
		- Using words that start with the same letter or sound, or rhtme in other ways (prepare, promote, ...)
	- Ideally with the main conclusion in it

- Summary:
	- Build up your paper little by little, take breaks if needed
	- Set realistic goals to make continuous small steps
	- Ask for help on what you find hard
	- Complain to your friends
	- Decide when good is good enough and submit!

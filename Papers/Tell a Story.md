1. Characters perform actions:
	- Make characters subjects and their actions verbs
	- Characters: tangible, concrete nouns
	- Use Abstract Nouns

		- Abstract nouns are good to help us say concisely what would otherwise take many words to explain
		- To readers, such nouns are confusing, especially when used as subjects
			- With an abstract subject, the reader can't visualise
		- We must use words which enable us to make pictures
			- e.g. The palm tree is by the shore
			-  From abstract nouns to concrete nouns
	- Language works by triggering within us pictures of how things are in the world
		- We must use words which enable us to make pictures -> concrete nouns

	- Clarity:
		- To ensure that your writing uses clear subjects and verbs, ask these four question:
			1. What is the action of the sentence? (What's happening?)
			2. Is the action the verb? If not, change it to match
			3. Who/What is doing the action?
			4. Is the doer the subject? If not, change it to match
2. Use strong verbs
	- Strong verbs clearly state an action taking place
	- They provide a better description than weak verbs
		- i.e. She <u>was walking</u> through the forest — She <u>walked</u> through the forest — She <u>strolled</u> through the forest (help to create visuals)
	- Favour *strong, specific, robust* action verbs (scrutinise, dissect, recount, capture) over *weak, vague, lazy* ones (have, do, show)
	- Limit your use of be-verbs (am, is, are, was, were, be and the nominal form being, been)
	- Watch out for 'there is'
		- Often 'there is' or 'there are' is extra weight and can be removed
		- i.e. There are many students who like writing -> Many students like writing
3. Place subjects and verbs close together
	- Large em-dashes or parenthesis sentences between the subject and the verb may difficult the reading
	- Examples:

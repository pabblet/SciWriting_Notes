- Readers interpret the substance based on clues they receive from its structure
- Research articles are divided into recognisable sections
	- The reader is going to get confuse if sections are mixed up
	- The same is true at the sentence or paragraph level

- Structuring paragraphs
	- Issue: 
		- Each paragraph should open by telling the reader what paragraph is about
		- The issue should end by introducing the characters and actions that will be featured in the rest of the paragraph
			- i.e 'Galaxy clusters are the largest virialised objects in the Universe.'
			- We now expect a paragraph about galaxy clusters
	- What makes a paragraph:
		1. Unity (the whole paragraph is about one concept)
		2. Order (information is presented logically)
		3. Coherence (all the concepts go well together)
		4. Completeness (is it wrapped up?)
	- Reader expectations:
		- Chronological order ([[Structure of a Paper#^7c3be7|Methods]])
		- General to Specific ([[Structure of a Paper#^2684e7|Introduction]])
		- Specific to general ([[Structure of a Paper#^c0cd57|Discussion]]/[[Structure of a Paper#^024333|Conclusion]])
		- Least important to most important (to persuade)
		- Problem to solution
		- Compare and contrast
	- Development:
		- After presenting the issue at the beginning of a paragraph, the writer expands on it in the development
		- Lay out well defined steps that lead to some conclusion
		- Some sentences will start with a transition word:
			- **Chronological order:** first, second, third, initially, then, finally, in conclusion, thus, to conclude, to summarise, another, after, before, earlier, later, meanwhile, ...
			- **General to Specific:** for example, for instance, namely, specifically, accordingly, therefore, thus, ...
			- **Least important to most important:** clearly, most importantly, the most serious, the foremost, ...
			- **Problem to solution:** but, however, in spite of, nevertheless, nonetheless, instead, still, yet, ...
			- **Compare and contrast:** similarly, also, just as, likewise, in contrast, on the contrary, however, on the one hand, ...
		- They help readers to navigate a written piece by making smooth connections between sentences and paragraphs, but too much can bury your ideas
	- Conclusion:
		- Readers look for a sentence at the end of a paragraph that serves as a kind of comprehension check
			- This conclusion is preceded by words such as 'Thus' if the conclusion is a summary, which is most common
			- Another possibility is to have the conclusion as a question or making a speculation. This would then start with 'Perhaps'
	- Maximum length of a paragraph in a well-writen research is about 15 sentences, but most paragraphs should be shorter
		- i.e. Boffin average 6.25 sentences per paragraph. Maximum 11, minimum 3)

- Structuring sentences
	- In general:
		- Start the sentence with its topic
		- End with what you want to stress
		- If not it feels choppy and incoherent
	- Topic position:
		- The information that begins a sentence establishes a perspective for viewing the sentence as a unit
			- Bees disperse pollen: tells us something about bees
			- Pollen is dispersed by bees: tell us something about pollen
	- Stress Position:
		- Readers naturally emphasise the material that arrives at the end of a sentence (the 'stress position')
		- When the writer puts the emphatic material elsewhere one of two things can happen:
			1. The reader guesses what to emphasise
			2. The reader assumes whatever is in the stress position is worth emphasising
	- Achieving flow — old before new
		- Put 'old' information in the beginning of your sentence, and 'new' information at the end
		- Begin sentences with information familiar to your reader

- The reader interpret the text:
	- They first look for structure:
		- Is this sentence, a paragraph?
		- Where is the subject and where is the verb?
	- Then, they will look for the substance
		- What is the message?
	- Bad writing is where the reader has to spend too much energy to understand the structure
	
- Emphasis:
	1. Main - independent- clause
	2. Save the best for the last
	3. Length — the longer the text, the more important must be
	4. Repetition  — don't hesitate to repeat; main result of a paper will be in the abstract, in the result, in the discussion, in the title, and in the introduction.
	5. Semantics — use of words
	
	
- Structure also affects substance
	- If your writing is not clear enough, the reader may not interpret the sentence as you wanted
	- Lists:
		- In a single sentence, you often tell your readers more than one piece of new information
		- Two or more pieces of information are easier to read and remember if their structures are *parallel*, that is, the items are written using similar kinds of words within similar grammatical arrangements
		- Make the list parallel by keeping the same structure
		- Parallel vs Not Parallel:

	- Avoid large sentences
		- Rule of thumb: Read your sentence out loud. If your run out of breath it is too long
		- Vary the length of your sentences
			- Make sentences smaller than about 20-25 words
	
- Punctuation
	- Punctuation serves as a pause within a sentence
	- Punctuation marks are also used to divide text into words and phrases when necessary in order to better clarify the meaning of those words or phrases
	- On the contrary, using punctuation incorrectly can convey an entirely different meaning of a sentence from the one that was originally intended
	- Compound Hyphens
		- 'A man-eating crocodile' is not the same as 'A man eating crocodile'
	- Commas
		- Use a comma before every (even the last) ***and*** or ***or*** in a series of three or more items
	- Increasing power to separate (less to more):
		1. Comma ,
		2. Colon :
		3. Dash —
		4. Parentheses ()
		5. Semicolon ;
		6. Period .
	- Increasing formality:
		1. Dash
		2. Parentheses
		3. The others (Comma, Colon, Semicolon, Period)

- Redundancy:
	- Many needless words are redundant. You can get rid of them with no harm to the message
	- Repetition — Instead of making one clear statement, writers repeat themselves using slightly different words
	- Excess detail — If they know this already, then no need to repeat it
	- Avoid redundant modifiers:

- Avoid negative:
	- Affirmative statements are often less wordy than negative ones
	- Negative statements are more opaque
	- Ask yourself if you cannot replace a negative by an affirmative

- Other words to avoid:
	- Avoid using 'really'
		- You can often remove it
	- Avoid using 'very'
		- It doesn't communicate enough information
		- There is often another word you can use instead 
			- Very afraid — Terrified
			- Very angry — Furious
			- Very hungry — Ravenous
	- Also 'Quite', 'Basically' and 'Generally'
		- These words seldom add anything useful
	- Don't say that you 'believe'
		- There is no 'belief' in science, only proven facts
		- Say that you think, that you're convinces that, or something similar
		- Or better, simply don't say it, as using  this makes you sound less confident

Plan your research as a series of short, complete projects. Then you could publish a paper after each project.

1. Prewriting (pre-overleaf document):
	- Keep logbook as detailed as possible
	- Be convinced you have a result (to avoid wasting time)
	- Decide on co-authors
	- Decide on the audience
		- Set the tone, length, and structure
	- One idea = one paper:
		1. What is the main message of your paper?
		2. Why is it crucial in yout field?
		3. What 'gap' does it fill in the literature?
		4. What impact or outlook does your work have in the field and why should the scientific community should care about your work?
	-  Discuss with colleagues
	-  Write an outline of the paper — [[Tell a Story|make a story]]
	-  Prepare figures and tables
2. Drafting:
	- Write quickly
		- Don't ponder over words
		- Leave gaps if necessary
		- Aim for a natural flow
	- Write in your own voice
		- Express yourself in your own way will help you to say what you mean more exactly
	- Write without interruption
		- Try to find a tima and place where you can think and write without distractions
	- Write without editing avoiding to get stuck and waste time
	- Keep to the plan of your outline if you feel stuck
3. Revising: ^69ec57
	- From writer to reader with the power of change
	- You can delete what is not needed and add what is missing
	- Make sure all your sentences and paragraph make sense
4. Editing:
	- Read the paper once all the way through
	- Reread all the way through out-loud or backwards (to check writing errors)
	- Look for:
		- [[Active vs Passive Voice#^f7e171|Passive voice]]
		- Inconsistent verbs
		- Grammar
		- Typos

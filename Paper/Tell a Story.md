1. Characters are concrete and do the actions:
	- Use Abstract Nouns

	- Language works by triggering within us pictures of how things are in the world
		- We must use words which enable us to make pictures -> concrete nouns

	- Clarity:
		- To ensure that your writing uses clear subjects and verbs, ask these four question:
			1. What is the action of the sentence? (What's happening?)
			2. Is the action the verb? If not, change it to match
			3. Who/What is doing the action?
			4. Is the doer the subject? If not, change it to match
2. Use strong verbs
	- i.e. She <u>was walking</u> through the forest — She <u>walked</u> through the forest — She <u>strolled</u> through the forest
	- Avoid weak words as 'am' or 'are' (missed the photo f)
	- Watch out for 'there is'
		- Often 'there is' or 'there are' is extra weight and can be removed
		- i.e. There are many students who like writing -> Many students like writing
3. Place subjects and verbs close together
	- Large em-dashes or parenthesis sentences between the subject and the verb may difficult the reading
	- Examples:

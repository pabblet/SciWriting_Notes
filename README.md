## About this Workshop
There is no science without communication and no successful scientists without good writing and communication skills. You can do the best science that exists, if you don’t write papers about it — papers that get cited! — and if you don’t give presentations that impress people, your science will likely be ignored. Moreover, if you do not write convincing proposals that appeal to non-specialists, you won’t get observing time, nor the coveted post-doc position and certainly not the very competitive but needed grants to fund your research. Finally, as a scientist, it is your duty and privilege to communicate your science to the general public, policy makers and the media, and like all the rest, this is something that needs to be learned.

This course is an introduction about how to get your message across in the various supports you need to use as a scientist, with an emphasis on how to write your scientific papers and proposals, and how to give a talk. Participants will learn how to shape their papers, how to write in a concise and lively way, what are the recipes to follow and the pitfalls to avoid for an excellent proposal, and what are the key rules for giving a stunning talk and presenting a poster.
